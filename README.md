This repo is a place for members of the 18F ClinicalTrials.gov team to organize their work. 


##Background

ClinicalTrials.gov is asite that provides patients, their family members, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the public access to information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies on a wide range of diseases and conditions. 

Beginning 2/27/17, The National Library of Medicine (NLM) within the National Institute of Health (NIH) engaged 18F in a six-week discorvery effort to identify alignment and discrepancies between the new ClinicalTrials.gov beta public site and the site's users.
